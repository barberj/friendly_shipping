        ID=\"0\"><Prohibitions>An issue of a publication in which more than 5 percent
        of its total advertising space is primarily directed to a Canadian market
        and which indicates:\n(a) Specifically where goods or services may be obtained
        in Canada, or \n(b) Specific items or conditions relating to the sale or provision
        of goods or services in Canada. \nAll alcoholic beverages including wines,
        etc.\nAn issue of a publication that contains an advertisement primarily directed
        to a Canadian market is a prohibited import if that advertisement does not
        appear in identical form in all editions of the issue distributed in the country
        of origin.\nArticles so marked as to create the false impression that they
        were made in Canada, Great Britain or any other British country.\nCommercial
        tags of metal.\nFirearms.\nGold bullion, gold dust, and nonmanufactured precious
        metals.\nNon-refillable lighters or any other lighter that contains fuel.
        New lighters with no fuel may be sent.\nOleomargarine and other butter substitutes,
        including altered or renovated butter.\nPerishable infectious biological substances.\nPerishable

        containing 66 mg/g or more nicotine by weight. Note: The U.S. Postal Service
        measures the concentration of nicotine solutions by volume rather than by
        weight, so it is possible that a product that does not exceed Canada's weight
        restriction would exceed the Postal Service's volume restriction. Nicotine
        solutions with a concentration of 16.67 percent (166 mg/ml) or more, when
        nicotine is the only toxic material in the liquid, are classified as \"dangerous
        goods\" (see 136.1) and as such are prohibited in international mail. (See
        also Observation 1.)\n</Prohibitions><Restrictions>Coins; banknotes; currency
        notes; securities payable to bearer; traveler's checks; gold, silver, platinum,
        manufactured or not; precious stones; jewelry; and other valuable articles
        may be sent only in insured parcels.\nDrugs and medicines must comply with
        Canadian law.\nEggs for hatching must be packed in new, clean containers and
        accompanied by a certificate issued by a veterinarian of the U.S. Department
        of Agriculture, or one issued by a State veterinarian and endorsed by a veterinarian
        of that Bureau, stating that to the best of his or her knowledge the eggs
        come from a flock that is free from Newcastle disease, fowl pest, or fowl
        typhoid. See 135.3 for method of packing.\nMeat and meat food products must
        be accompanied by an export certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
        and labeled in accordance with Canadian regulations. Exception to these requirements
        are:\n1. bona fide sample shipments weighing less than 10 kg; \n2. meat products
        addressed to a government department or agency; \n3. meat products intended
        for personal consumption when they enter Canada in the possession of the importer.
        \nPet food that contains biologically appropriate raw food or bones and raw
        food - such as heat-processed, shelf-stable pet foods, treats, and compound
        chews - must be accompanied by an import permit from the Canadian Food Inspection
        Agency and a zoo sanitary certificate from the United States Department of
        Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinarian
        Services. Attach a copy of both documents to the outside of the mailpiece
        for review by the Canada Border Service Agency.\nVeterinary biological products
        including serums and vaccines must be accompanied by a permit issued by the
        Veterinary Director General, Ministry of Agriculture of Canada.</Restrictions><Observations>1.
        As noted in the Prohibitions section, Canada prohibits certain vaping products.
        However, vaping products, otherwise known as electronic smoking products (i.e.,
        electronic products for the vaporization and administration of inhaled doses
        of nicotine including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and pipes,
        as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related products), that make
        health claims are subject to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act (FDA). \"Health
        claims\" refers to any statement that represents the product as a drug or
        device under section 2 of the FDA - for example, a statement that the product
        will help someone quit smoking. Vaping products that make health claims require
        authorization under the FDA before being commercially imported, advertised,
        or sold in Canada. A vaping product that makes health claims is considered
        a prescription drug, and before importation to Canada, it requires a Drug
        Establishment License and an assigned corresponding Drug Identification Number
        (DIN). For more information, visit canada.ca/en/health-canada/topics/licensing-authorizing-manufacturing-drug-health-products.html.
        Vaping products with no health claims and no drugs other than nicotine are
        not subject to the FDA.\n2. Banknotes valued at $100 or more must be put up
        in a compact package and securely tied with strong twine before wrapping.
        The wrapper must be linen or other strong, woven material, linen lined paper,
        or two thicknesses of strong kraft paper. After wrapping, the package must
        be again securely tied or stitched and sealed at the points of closing. \n3.
        The name of the Canadian province in which the office of destination is located
        must appear as part of the address. \n4. The following must not be accepted
        for insurance: \nBees, postage stamps (canceled and uncanceled) and albums
        in which they are mounted, and parcels addressed to CFPOs. \n5. Canadian Forces
        Mail (CFPO) is processed through Canadian military post offices and must be
        addressed in the following manner: \n(a) NUMBER, RANK, NAME UNIT \n(b) CFPO
        (NUMBER) \n(c) BELLEVILLE ON K0K 3R0 \n(d) CANADA \nMaximum weight limits
        for mail addressed to members of the Canadian Forces based outside of Canada
        (CFPO) is 22 pounds. Parcels for CFPO addresses may not be insured. Direct
        sacks of printed matter (M-bags) are not permitted for CFPO addresses.\n6.
        A letter fully prepaid and bearing the same address as that of a parcel may
        be tied or otherwise securely attached to the outside of the parcel. Stamps
        to cover postage on the parcel must be affixed to the wrapper of the parcel.
        Stamps to pay postage on the letter must be affixed to the envelope thereof.
        \n7. Certain types of merchandise must be marked to show country of origin
        in the manner prescribed by the Canadian customs regulations. \n8. Goods valued
        under 20 Canadian dollars are duty and excise tax exempt. Goods over 20 Canadian
        dollars will be subject to the applicable duties and excise taxes. Gift shipments
        received by mail that are valued under 60 Canadian dollars are duty and excise
        tax exempt. \n9. For all casual and commercial goods valued at or under 1,600
        Canadian dollars, Canada Post will collect assessed duties, excise taxes,
        and a handling fee from the addressee.  This handling fee is set by Canada
        Post (see http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGcustoms-e.asp). All commercial
        mail items over 1,600 Canadian dollars will be held by Canada Customs and
        Excise until proper invoice and accounting documentation is provided by the
        addressee.\n10. The Canada Customs Invoice can be obtained from stationery,
        office supply, or printing companies. If mailers are unable to obtain the
        Canada Customs Invoice locally, they should visit the following Web site:
        www.canadapost.ca. In addition, commercial invoices are acceptable provided
        that each invoice has the required information for customs purposes. \n11.
        Information on Canadian customs regulations may be obtained from the Office
        of International Marketing/223, Bureau of International Commerce, Department
        of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, or any field office of that Department.

        Corporation web site on the Internet at http://www.canadapost.ca. \n13. Pursuant
        to the Canada Customs Act and a need to heighten border security, Canada will
        deny entry of all postal items (except postcards) that do not bear complete
        sender and addressee information in roman letters and arabic numerals. </Observations><CustomsForms>First-Class
