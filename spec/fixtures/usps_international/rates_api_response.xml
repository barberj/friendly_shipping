    <Prohibitions>An issue of a publication in which more than 5 percent of its total advertising space is primarily directed to a Canadian market and which indicates:
(a) Specifically where goods or services may be obtained in Canada, or 
(b) Specific items or conditions relating to the sale or provision of goods or services in Canada. 
All alcoholic beverages including wines, etc.
An issue of a publication that contains an advertisement primarily directed to a Canadian market is a prohibited import if that advertisement does not appear in identical form in all editions of the issue distributed in the country of origin.
Articles so marked as to create the false impression that they were made in Canada, Great Britain or any other British country.
Commercial tags of metal.
Firearms.
Gold bullion, gold dust, and nonmanufactured precious metals.
Non-refillable lighters or any other lighter that contains fuel. New lighters with no fuel may be sent.
Oleomargarine and other butter substitutes, including altered or renovated butter.
Perishable infectious biological substances.
Perishable noninfectious biological substances.
Plumage and skins of wild birds.
Prison-made goods being sold or intended for sale by a person or firm.
Radioactive materials.
Replica or inert munitions, as well as other devices that simulate explosive devices or munitions, including replica or inert grenades or other simulated military munitions, whether or not such items are for display purposes.

Smoke-making devices for motor vehicles and boats.
Used or secondhand hives or bee supplies.
Vaping liquids containing 66 mg/g or more nicotine by weight. Note: The U.S. Postal Service measures the concentration of nicotine solutions by volume rather than by weight, so it is possible that a product that does not exceed Canada's weight restriction would exceed the Postal Service's volume restriction. Nicotine solutions with a concentration of 16.67 percent (166 mg/ml) or more, when nicotine is the only toxic material in the liquid, are classified as "dangerous goods" (see 136.1) and as such are prohibited in international mail. (See also Observation 1.)

3. meat products intended for personal consumption when they enter Canada in the possession of the importer.

Attach a copy of both documents to the outside of the mailpiece for review by the Canada Border Service Agency.
Veterinary biological products including serums and vaccines must be accompanied by a permit issued by the Veterinary Director General, Ministry of Agriculture of Canada.</Restrictions>
    <Observations>1. As noted in the Prohibitions section, Canada prohibits certain vaping products. However, vaping products, otherwise known as electronic smoking products (i.e., electronic products for the vaporization and administration of inhaled doses of nicotine including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and pipes, as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related products), that make health claims are subject to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act (FDA). "Health claims" refers to any statement that represents the product as a drug or device under section 2 of the FDA - for example, a statement that the product will help someone quit smoking. Vaping products that make health claims require authorization under the FDA before being commercially imported, advertised, or sold in Canada. A vaping product that makes health claims is considered a prescription drug, and before importation to Canada, it requires a Drug Establishment License and an assigned corresponding Drug Identification Number (DIN). For more information, visit canada.ca/en/health-canada/topics/licensing-authorizing-manufacturing-drug-health-products.html. Vaping products with no health claims and no drugs other than nicotine are not subject to the FDA.

The wrapper must be linen or other strong, woven material, linen lined paper, or two thicknesses of strong kraft paper. After wrapping, the package must be again securely tied or stitched and sealed at the points of closing. 
3. The name of the Canadian province in which the office of destination is located must appear as part of the address. 
4. The following must not be accepted for insurance:

Maximum weight limits for mail addressed to members of the Canadian Forces based outside of Canada (CFPO) is 22 pounds. Parcels for CFPO addresses may not be insured. Direct sacks of printed matter (M-bags) are not permitted for CFPO addresses.
6. A letter fully prepaid and bearing the same address as that of a parcel may be tied or otherwise securely attached to the outside of the parcel. Stamps to cover postage on the parcel must be affixed to the wrapper of the parcel. Stamps to pay postage on the letter must be affixed to the envelope thereof. 
7. Certain types of merchandise must be marked to show country of origin in the manner prescribed by the Canadian customs regulations. 
8. Goods valued under 20 Canadian dollars are duty and excise tax exempt. Goods over 20 Canadian dollars will be subject to the applicable duties and excise taxes. Gift shipments received by mail that are valued under 60 Canadian dollars are duty and excise tax exempt. 
9. For all casual and commercial goods valued at or under 1,600 Canadian dollars, Canada Post will collect assessed duties, excise taxes, and a handling fee from the addressee.  This handling fee is set by Canada Post (see http://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGcustoms-e.asp). All commercial mail items over 1,600 Canadian dollars will be held by Canada Customs and Excise until proper invoice and accounting documentation is provided by the addressee.
10. The Canada Customs Invoice can be obtained from stationery, office supply, or printing companies. If mailers are unable to obtain the Canada Customs Invoice locally, they should visit the following Web site: www.canadapost.ca. In addition, commercial invoices are acceptable provided that each invoice has the required information for customs purposes.
